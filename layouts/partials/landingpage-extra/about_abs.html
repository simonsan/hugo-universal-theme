                    <h4>openage is a free and open-source RTS-game engine that reimplements the Genie Engine from scratch.</h4> </br>

                    <p>It has a lot of improvements over the 20-year old components of the Genie engine, adds completely new features on top and provides better performance due to different design decisions being made and using modern technology. We use dedicated-server with matchmaking for our multiplayer and highly efficient and cross-platform graphics rendering with Vulkan.</p>
